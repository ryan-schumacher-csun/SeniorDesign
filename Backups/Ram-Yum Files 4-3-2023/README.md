# SeniorDesign
Senior design project featuring our company Ram-Yum. 
A small mom and pop ramen restaurant that has been around for a while. 
They want to improve their business model to integrate newer technologies. 
In this project we will work on creating a website for the restaurant with an online ordering system. 
Customers will be able to place orders online then walk in and pick up their orders. 
The online ordering system will also allow customers to customize their orders. 
They can also prepay for their orders using a credit card.
